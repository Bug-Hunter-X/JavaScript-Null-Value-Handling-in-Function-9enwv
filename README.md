# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue with null values in JavaScript and a suggested solution.

The `bug.js` file contains a function that adds two numbers, but it has a potential issue with null values.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version, handling null values more gracefully.
